# Emergent
A highly scalable, performant, fault tolerant python library for writing Distributed Systems in the presence of non-byzantine failures. It is based on Raft Consensus and while there exists other Raft based distributed systems python library, none are designed to take advantage of parallel cpu cores. It is currently in testing phase.
